## Welcome to neuraxis!

Hey there! 👋 I'm excited to introduce you to neuraxis, my passion project aimed at breaking down communication barriers through real-time Indian Sign Language (ISL) translation. As someone deeply invested in both web development and machine learning, I've poured my heart and soul into creating a platform that seamlessly bridges the gap between spoken language and ISL.

## What's neuraxis all about?

neuraxis is more than just an app – it's a gateway to inclusive communication. Here's what it does:

1. **Speech to Sign Conversion**: Speak into your device, and watch as neuraxis translates it into ISL in real-time.
2. **Text to Sign Conversion**: Type your message, and see it transformed into ISL gestures.
3. **Sign to Speech Conversion**: Use your camera to sign, and neuraxis will convert it to spoken words.
4. **Sign to Text Conversion**: Sign away, and neuraxis will transcribe it into text.

## The Tech Behind the Magic

### Web Development
I've built the frontend using cutting-edge web technologies to ensure a smooth, responsive user experience:

- **React**: For building a dynamic, efficient user interface.
- **Next.js**: Leveraging server-side rendering for lightning-fast page loads.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For crafting a sleek, modern design without the hassle of writing custom CSS.

### Machine Learning
The real magic happens behind the scenes with some powerful ML models:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: I use advanced NLP techniques to tokenize and understand text input.
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV and MediaPipe are the backbone of our sign language recognition system.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: This helps in accurately classifying different hand gestures.
- **Large Language Model (LLM)**: For generating natural language from classified signs.

## Getting Started

Want to give neuraxis a spin? Here's how:

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run the development server with `npm start`
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

## Join the Journey

neuraxis is more than just a project – it's a mission to make communication accessible to everyone. Whether you're a developer, a sign language enthusiast, or someone passionate about accessibility, I'd love for you to be part of this journey.
